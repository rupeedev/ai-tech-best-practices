## Introduction

Last year we published** **[**a review of core dashboard tools**](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/core-app-dashboard-building-tools), highlighting several common challenges teams encounter when building data visualizations. Most of the tools we discussed were mature commercial products with good user experience, yet they offered limited flexibility in licensing, deployment, and extensibility. In conversations with readers afterward, we learned that many teams were actually seeking lower cost, more customizable, and** **[**self hosted**](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/7-self-hosted-ai-tools-build-business-app) open source alternatives.

Over the past year, the open source ecosystem in this space has evolved quickly. Increasingly, dashboard and analytics tools are incorporating AI into their core features, including natural language querying, automated chart creation, metric explanations, and semantic report generation. Many teams also hope these tools can handle more of the operational workload so they can focus their time on decisions that require real business judgment.

With this context in mind, we curated a new list of active open source dashboard projects that have already introduced AI capabilities. In this article, we look at each tool through three lenses: its core positioning, common use cases, and the maturity and scope of its AI features. We hope this helps you quickly identify which open source tool best fits your needs.

Here is a quick overview of the six tools we will cover.

## Closing notes

Commercial BI tools remain reliable choices for enterprise analytics, but considerations such as licensing, deployment constraints, and extensibility lead many teams to explore open source alternatives. When budgets are limited or customization is important, open source tools often provide more flexibility and support gradual, iterative adoption.

From the six tools discussed:

* For lightweight dashboards with minimal upkeep, Redash, Grafana, or Wren AI are strong candidates.
* For platforms that combine business applications, data management, and analytics, NocoBase, Appsmith, or Metabase are better aligned.
