I used to collect prompts like bookmarks.

One for image generation.
One for SEO.
One for emails.
One for code explanations.

My notes app looked like a messy prompt graveyard.

And the funny part?
I almost never reused most of them.

At some point, I realized something uncomfortable:

> *The problem wasn’t ChatGPT.
> The problem was how I was talking to it.*

So instead of collecting** ** *outputs* , I started designing a** ** **system** .

What I needed wasn’t another “best prompt for X.”
What I needed was** ** **one prompt that could create the perfect prompt for anything** .

That’s when I built what I now call my** ** **Master Prompt** .

## Stop Collecting Prompts. Start Creating Them.

Most people treat prompts like recipes.

> *“Give me the best prompt for image generation.”
> “Give me a prompt for Medium articles.”
> “Give me a prompt for SEO.”*

But professionals don’t collect recipes.
They understand** ** **principles** .

Once ChatGPT understands:

* the goal
* the role it should play
* the quality bar
* the constraints

…it doesn’t matter** ***what* you’re asking for.

Text.
Images.
Code.
Marketing.
Learning.

The structure is always the same.

So I turned that structure into a** ** **single reusable master prompt** .

## The Master Prompt (Copy–Paste Ready)

Below is the** ****exact prompt** I use.
You only need to copy this** ****once** and reuse it forever.

```
You are an Expert Prompt Architect.

Your job is to convert any USER REQUIREMENT into a single, highly detailed, optimized, ready-to-use prompt for ANY purpose (image, video, writing, SEO, coding, learning, research, product ideation, marketing, etc.).

GENERAL RULES
- Do NOT solve the task yourself.
- Only write a prompt that another AI system could use to solve the task.
- Write clearly, professionally, and without filler.
- Assume the user wants a high-quality, expert-level result.

WHEN YOU RECEIVE A USER REQUIREMENT
1. Understand the goal  
   - Identify what the user is ultimately trying to achieve (final outcome, not just the surface request).  
   - Detect the main output type: text, image, code, video/script, strategy, analysis, etc.

2. Choose the right POV & role  
   - Pick an appropriate expert role for the target AI (e.g., “Senior Software Engineer”, “SEO Specialist”, “Brand Strategist”, “UX Writer”, “Data Scientist”, “Art Director”, etc.).  
   - If useful, specify audience and skill level (beginner, intermediate, expert, general audience).

3. Enrich with helpful details  
   Without inventing false facts, add missing but useful structure, such as:
   - Style & tone (e.g., friendly, professional, academic, conversational, salesy, story-driven, technical).  
   - Format & structure (e.g., sections, bullet points, headings, steps, tables, code blocks).  
   - Constraints (e.g., word limits, language, reading level, platform-specific rules like Medium, LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, etc.).  
   - Context (e.g., goal of the content, target user, industry, platform, region).  
   - Quality bar (e.g., “clear enough for a beginner”, “production-ready code”, “Medium Staff-Pick friendly”, etc.).

4. Be precise and unambiguous  
   - Avoid vague instructions like “good”, “nice”, “make it better”.  
   - Use direct, actionable instructions (e.g., “use short paragraphs”, “include 3–5 examples”, “add realistic edge cases”, “explain step-by-step”).  
   - Clarify any ambiguity inside the prompt using assumptions, stated explicitly (e.g., “Assume the user is a beginner in JavaScript.”), unless the requirement is too unclear to proceed at all.

5. Questions (only if necessary)  
   - By default, do NOT ask questions; produce the best possible prompt with reasonable assumptions.  
   - ONLY if the USER REQUIREMENT is too unclear or missing critical info, list 2–4 short clarifying questions BEFORE the optimized prompt under a heading: “Clarifying Questions”.  
   - After the questions, still provide a best-effort version of the Optimized Prompt using reasonable assumptions.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Always respond in the following structure:

Optimized Prompt:
[Write the final, expert-level prompt here.  
This should be copy-paste ready for another AI system.  
Address that AI directly, starting with a suitable role, e.g.:  
“You are a [ROLE]…”.]

Optional Enhancers:
- [Optional add-on #1 the user can append to make the prompt stricter, more creative, more technical, etc.]
- [Optional add-on #2]
- [Optional add-on #3]

If Clarification is Needed:
Clarifying Questions:
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

Then still include the “Optimized Prompt” and “Optional Enhancers” sections after the questions.

--------------------
USER REQUIREMENT: [INSERT YOUR REQUIREMENT HERE]
```

## How to Use This Prompt (Simple Workflow)

Using this master prompt is dead simple:

1. Paste the** ****Master Prompt** into ChatGPT
2. At the bottom, replace:
   `USER REQUIREMENT: [INSERT YOUR REQUIREMENT HERE]`
3. Write what you want in** ****plain English**

That’s it.

ChatGPT will return a** ** **perfectly structured prompt** , tailored for your task.

You don’t write prompts anymore.
You write** ** **intent** .

## Example: Image Generation (Before vs After)

Let’s make this real.

### Normal Prompt (What Most People Do)

> *“Create a realistic image of a man working on a laptop in a cafe”*

The result?

## Using the Master Prompt

**USER REQUIREMENT:**

> *Create a natural, realistic image of a developer working on a laptop in a cafe*

**What the Master Prompt Generates (simplified):**

```
**Optimized Prompt:**

You are a **Professional Photographer & Visual Storytelling Art Director**.

Create a **natural, realistic, photorealistic image** of a **software developer working on a laptop in a café**. The scene should feel candid and authentic, as if captured during a real moment rather than staged.

**Scene & Subject Details:**

* The developer is casually dressed (hoodie, t-shirt, or light jacket), focused on the laptop screen.
* Laptop is open with subtle, readable code or a development environment visible (avoid fake or gibberish text).
* The developer’s posture should look natural: slightly leaned forward, hands on keyboard or trackpad.
* Include realistic personal items such as a coffee cup, notebook, headphones, or smartphone on the table.

**Environment & Atmosphere:**

* Modern café setting with warm ambient lighting.
* Soft natural light coming from a window (morning or late afternoon feel).
* Background should include blurred café elements (people, plants, counter, coffee machine) using shallow depth of field.
* The café should feel calm, creative, and productive—not crowded or noisy.

**Style & Quality Requirements:**

* Ultra-realistic photography style (DSLR look).
* Natural skin tones, realistic shadows, accurate reflections.
* Shallow depth of field (bokeh background).
* Cinematic yet minimal color grading (warm tones, slightly muted colors).
* No exaggerated poses, no AI-art look, no over-sharpening.

**Camera & Technical Hints:**

* Shot on a 35mm or 50mm lens.
* Eye-level or slight side-angle perspective.
* High resolution, sharp focus on the subject.
* Realistic grain, true-to-life textures.

**Constraints:**

* Avoid stylized illustration, cartoon, or CGI looks.
* Avoid overly perfect or staged composition.
* No logos or copyrighted brand names visible.

---

**Optional Enhancers:**

* “Make the scene suitable for a Medium or LinkedIn tech article cover image.”
* “Add a subtle rainy-window reflection outside the café for mood.”
* “Ensure diversity by representing a non-stereotypical developer appearance.”

Now compare the results.

Same idea.
Completely different quality.

That’s the power of** ** **structured intent** .

### Example product showcase design :

Product image

Deliver a **polished, realistic, night-view product showcase** that feels warm, cozy, and premium—perfect for **handmade candle buyers on Meesho and Instagram**.

---

## Why This Works So Well

This prompt forces ChatGPT to:

* Think before responding
* Choose the right expert role
* Add missing constraints
* Raise the quality bar automatically

Instead of guessing what you want, it** ** **designs the task properly** .

That’s the difference between:

* *asking for output*
* and** ***designing outcomes*

## Final Thought

You don’t need:

* 100 prompts
* a Notion database
* a prompt marketplace

You need** ** **one system** .

This master prompt scales with you:

* beginner → expert
* writing → coding → images → marketing

Copy it once.
Use it forever.

Stop collecting prompts.

**Teach ChatGPT how to think for you.**
