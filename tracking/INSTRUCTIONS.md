# How to Instruct Me

To ensure I can help you efficiently and accurately, please follow these guidelines when giving me tasks:

1.  **Be Specific and Clear:** The more precise your request, the better I can execute it. Instead of "fix the code," try "Refactor the `calculate_total` function in `main.py` to correctly apply a 10% discount before adding tax."

2.  **Provide Context:** Tell me *why* you need a change. This helps me understand the goal and make better decisions. For example, "Optimize the image loading process because the homepage is too slow."

3.  **One Major Task at a Time:** For complex goals, it's best to break them down into smaller, sequential steps. I can help you with this if you describe the overall objective.

4.  **Refer to Specific Files and Functions:** When you want me to read, write, or modify something, please mention the exact file paths, function names, or class names.

5.  **Review My Plan:** For complex tasks, I will propose a plan of action. Please review it and let me know if it aligns with your expectations before I proceed.

6.  **Correct Me:** If I misunderstand or make a mistake, simply tell me what I did wrong and clarify the instruction.

7.  **Consult Code Summary:** Always read the document in `app/app_directory_summary.md` before working on tasks that involve the `app/` directory.
